## calc

A simple calculator program I made to help out with my PSXEmu.

Right now it just does simple arithmetic, but works in dec, hex, oct and bin.

### Usage
Either input as an argument (in quotes), or run to input multiple equations.

Type "q", "quit" or "exit" to quit.

Split equations with `;`. `ans` or `a` can be used in the 2nd equation and on to chain equations together.

### Supported operators
+, -, *, /, ^

### Flags
-h for hex output
-o for octal output
-b for binary output
